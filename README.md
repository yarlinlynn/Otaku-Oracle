# 🌸 Otaku Oracle

**Otaku Oracle** is a playful and personalized recommendation tool for manga, anime, and manhwa lovers. Whether you're unsure what to read next or already have something in mind, the app guides you through a fun quiz or lets you search by keywords to discover new stories tailored to your taste. Built with JavaScript by two entry-level developers, it’s a creative way to combine fandom and frontend skills—one question, genre, and character at a time.

## 🧠 What is Otaku Oracle?

Otaku Oracle is a manga recommendation app that acts like a friendly quiz game. Users answer a series of simple questions, and based on their responses, the app filters a list of manga to find titles tailored to their taste. Whether you're new to manga or just don’t know what to read next, Otaku Oracle offers a guided experience to help you discover your next favorite series.

<br/>

## 🎯 Why We're Building It

This project was created as a way to:

- Learn and practice **JavaScript fundamentals** (DOM manipulation, event handling, filtering arrays, etc.)
- Collaborate as junior developers on a shared passion project
- Explore how to build interactive front-end applications with dynamic logic
- Build a solid logic-first foundation before working on design

> ❗ **Note:** UI/UX is not our first priority — this project is logic-focused and will evolve as we grow.

<br/>

## 📌 Current Scope (MVP)

Right now, Otaku Oracle is:

- Focused **only on manga recommendations**
- Built entirely in **JavaScript**
- Driven by a **questionnaire experience**
- Delivering filtered results based on:
  - Age demographic (teen/adult)
  - Genre preferences (coming soon)
- Displaying results with:
  - Title
  - Mangaka (author)
  - Publication info (start/end/ongoing)
  - Volume count
  - Manga image

Each question appears **one at a time**, creating a clean and focused user journey.

## 🔮 Planned Features & Future Expansion

As we continue learning and building, we plan to add:

- A fully JavaScript-based **Landing Page**
  - Welcomes users to the app
  - Introduces the experience
  - Buttons to "Start Quiz" or "Search by Keyword"

- **Anime and Manhwa Support**
  - Users can choose their preferred format (Manga / Anime / Manhwa)
  - Manhwa (Korean comics) will have their own recommendation lists

- **Search Bar Feature**
  - For users who know what they’re looking for
  - Search by title, mood, genre, or keyword
  - Complements the quiz for broader use

- **Genre & Demographic Expansion**
  - Additional questions based on selected demographic
  - Shounen, Shoujo, Seinen, Josei paths with tailored follow-ups

> 💡 This is a learning-based project — structure and flow will change frequently as we improve our code and rethink features!

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Markup for pages
- **CSS3** – Base styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – Core logic, quiz progression, event handling, filtering, and rendering content

<br/>

## 🔗 Data & API Usage

Currently, we're using a manually curated list of manga for testing.

Later, we plan to integrate a third-party API (like [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/) or [AniList](https://anilist.gitbook.io)) to dynamically pull in manga, anime, and manhwa data.

This will allow us to:

- Keep the app up-to-date
- Expand our library
- Offer more diverse and accurate recommendations

<br/>

## 🌐 Landing Page Plan

We’ll build a **dynamic landing page** with JavaScript that:

- Greets users with a short welcoming message
- Introduces the app and how it works
- Presents buttons to:
  - "Start the Quiz"
  - "Search for Titles"

This page will serve as the entry point before the questionnaire.

## 🙌 Contributing or Watching?

This project is our coding sandbox — a hands-on place to learn JavaScript through trial, error, and creative problem-solving.

Feel free to fork or watch if you're a beginner too!

> Expect bugs, changes, and messy experiments — that’s part of the fun.

## 💬 FAQ

**Is Otaku Oracle finished?**  
Not yet! We’re actively building, testing, and learning.

**Can I use it now?**  
The manga-based questionnaire is our current focus. Anime, manhwa, and search will follow.

**Why isn’t the design polished yet?**  
We’re prioritizing logic and JavaScript functionality first — design comes later!

**Where do your recommendations come from?**  
Right now, we’re using a sample array. Soon, we’ll fetch from an API.
